Some of the group projects that have been undertaken in previous workshops are listed 
below. These should give you an idea of the scope of a project that can be undertaken.

### Mapping weather forecasts

The Met Office produces accessible .csv files with weather forecasts for various 
locations across the UK every three hours over the next 24 hours. This project
downloaded this data and plotted the results on a map. The user selected the time
to plot. The files are located at [https://github.com/dpfinch/MetData](https://github.com/dpfinch/MetData).

### DNA data for alphaproteobacteria

Alphaproteobacteria are thought to have different ratios of base pairs in their DNA
depending on environmental conditions. This project sought to test this idea by reading
DNA sequences in the festa file format, calculate the base pair ratio, and explore how
this changes with the latitude where the sample was collected. The files are located at
[https://github.com/CyanoEvo/global_G-C_map](https://github.com/CyanoEvo/global_G-C_map).

### Fit equations of state

The relationship between pressure and density of materials in the Earth's deep interior 
can be described by several different equations of state. This project sought to compare
the fit of different equations to various data sets. The files are located at [https://github.com/gracecox/EoSeval](https://github.com/gracecox/EoSeval).

# Group project

This repository holds instructions for a one-day group project activity
intended to reinforce some of the concepts taught in Software Carpentry
lessons. We have developed this activity over three iterations of a three-day
training course based on the Software Carpentry syllabus and funded by NERC
via their ATSC scheme in 2014/15 and 2015/16. Our aim is to capture the
participant instructions and our experiances somewhere where others can benifit.

We break the class into groups of 4-6 people and set the group activity, which
is to:

> Find at least one data set relevant to your research
>
> Perform some relevant analysis on this data (which may involve combining it
> with data from another source). Visualise this data in an appropriate manner
> (graph, chart, map, etc.)
>
> Allow the user to interact with the visualisation in some way (eg. select 
> range of time series, temperatures, dates) to dynamically redraw visualisation
> 
> Ensuring that you:
>  * Make use of the principles we have learned over the past two days
>  * Document and prepare a short presentation for the end of day three

Participants often enjoy this actvity, but there are pitfalls that we have
attempted to document.
